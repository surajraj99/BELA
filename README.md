# BELA
## Accurate and Noninvasive Ploidy Prediction for Human Preimplantation Embryos

## Project Description

This project aims to enhance the assessment of fertilized human embryos, a critical step in the process of in vitro fertilization (VF). The research paper behind this project introduced BELA, the Blastocyst Evaluation Learning Algorithm, a novel model for embryo ploidy status prediction. It surpasses both image- and video-based ploidy models without necessitating any subjective input from embryologists. This project uses deep learning techniques to accurately and noninvasively predict ploidy in preimplantation human embryos.

## Code Description

The code in this repository forms the backbone of the BELA model. It is designed to use time-lapse imaging to predict embryo ploidy status and identify critical time points during embryo development that would maximize prediction accuracy. Specifically, it leverages deep learning techniques and uses video classification models to outperform single image classification models.

## Instructions for Use

The BELA system uses several Python packages. Before running any of the scripts, ensure the following dependencies are installed in your Python environment.

Files available provide code for training and evaluating a BELA model through:
1. Video Creation
2. Annotation File Creation
3. Training and Prediction
